# PowerShell_font_installer

I got this script from the awesome user mivk on SuperUser (StackExchange). I've deployed it to a great degree of success.

I simply perform the following actions on the PC:
1. give myself admin privileges
2. gather the fonts I want installed into one folder
3. create a .txt file in that same folder
4. paste the script into the .txt file (Notepad is fine)
5. save it as .vbs file
6. double-click the .vbs file

Done.
